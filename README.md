## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The following variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the MechaCar_mpg dataset:
	- vehicle_length
	- vehicle_weight
	- ground clearance
	
	These variables will always have a given value that does not change.


- The p-value of this multiple linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10(-11), which is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%; therefore, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the slope of the linear model is not zero.


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not?
- This multiple linear regression model has an R-value of 0.72, which suggests there is a strong correlation


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Design specifications for MechaCar suspension coils dictates the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch (PSI).  The mean and median values for Lots 1 and 2 are very close and are within design specifications.  Lot 3 had the most variance and exceeded manufacturer specifications.
